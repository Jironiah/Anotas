# Jinotas!

App to simulate a notepad with the interesting options such as uploading only the notes that are not already at the cloud, manage the external or local notes...


# Create and delete notes locally

Working locally you can create, modify or delete all the notes one by one.


## Create a note

The first you must do is create a note (title and content) and store it locally

## Modify a note

Having a note, if you want you can change all the data created previously created.

## Delete a note

In case you want to delete any note, there two options to delete, one by one or all the notes.


# Upload and download notes to the server

You can upload all the notes that are not already at the cloud as you can also download all the notes that are not stored in the device database 

## Upload a note

So if we have several notes that we want to upload there's an options to upload all the notes that are not already in the server and those will be available to download by the other users.


## Download a note

With this notes in the server it's time to download all the them and be free to read and modify them or (in case we have modify one of them) upload them again.
